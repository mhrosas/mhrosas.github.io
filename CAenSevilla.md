## Antiguos Estudiantes y estudiantes visitantes:

- [Laura Colmenarejo](https://sites.google.com/view/l-colmenarejo/home)
  > Laura finished her PhD thesis titled "Stability in the combinatorics of representation theory" in 2016.
  > Laura currently hold a tenure track position at North Carolina State Univesity, and a rising star in the area of Algebraic Combinatorics.
  
- [Stefan Trandafir](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Stefan-Trandafir)
  > Stefan was a frecuent visitor to the group during his PhD at
  >  Simon Fraser University in Vacouver. He currently holds a
  > postdoctoral position with the quantum information group of
  >  Adan Cabello in Sevilla.
- [Álvaro Gutiérrez Cáceres](https://sites.google.com/view/gutierrez-caceres/)

  > Álvaro's undergraduate senior thesis resulted into two publications
  > on the study of the plethysm. Atfer Sevilla he did a Master's
  >  thesis at the University of Bonn under Catharina Stroppel
  > and Jacob Matherne, and is currently pursuing his phd under
  > Mark Wildon at Briston.

- Luis Esquivias and Adrian Lillo.
   > In a working grupo (together with Álvaro and the senior
   > members of the group), Luis and Álvaro found a combinatorial proof
   >  of the Graham and Pollak formula for the determinant of the
   > distance matrix of a tree based on the Gessel-Viennot involution.
