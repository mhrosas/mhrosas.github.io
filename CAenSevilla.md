<H2> Antiguos Estudiantes y estudiantes visitantes:</H2>

- [Laura Colmenarejo](https://sites.google.com/view/l-colmenarejo/home)
  > Laura finished her PhD thesis titled "Stability in the combinatorics of representation theory" in 2016. 
  > Laura currently hold a tenure track position at North Carolina State Univesity.
  > Laura is a rising star in the area of Algebraic Combinatorics.

  
  
- [Stefan Trandafir](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Stefan-Trandafir)
  > Stefan was a frecuent visitor to the group during
  >  his PhD at Simon Fraser University in Vacouver. During
  > this time, he delved into some ideas regarding the
  > study of Kronecker coefficients, which partially stemmed
  > from our group's discussions.
  > Additionally, he wrote an article with us on a new
  > symmetry exhibited by the Littlewood-Richardso
  > coefficients.
  > 
  > Stefan currently holds a
  > postdoctoral position with the quantum information group of
  >  Adan Cabello in Sevilla.
  
- [Álvaro Gutiérrez Cáceres](https://sites.google.com/view/gutierrez-caceres/)

  > Álvaro's undergraduate senior thesis yielded two
  > publications on the study of the plethysm of
  > symmetric functions. Following his time in
  >  Sevilla, Álvaro authored a Master's thesis at the
  > University of Bonn under the supervision of Catharina
  > Stroppel and Jacob Matherne. Presently, Álvaro is pursuing
  >  his Ph.D. under the guidance of Mark Wildon at
  > Bristol University.

- [Luis Esquivias](https://www.linkedin.com/in/luis-esquivias-quintero-60214a264/) and [Adrian Lillo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adri%C3%A1n-lillo-pinto-1b1359180/).
  > In collaboration with Álvaro and the senior members of the group,
  > Luis and Álvaro, both undergraduate students at the time,
  > discovered a combinatorial proof of the Graham and Pollak formula
  > for the determinant of the distance matrix of a tree, utilizing
  >  the Gessel-Viennot involution.
