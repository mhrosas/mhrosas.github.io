# Combinatoria Algebraica en Sevilla


## Miembros:

- [Emmanuel Briand](http://emmanuel.jean.briand.free.fr/)


- [Mercedes Rosas](https://mhrosas.github.io/)


## Antiguos Estudiantes y estudiantes visitantes:

- [Laura Colmenarejo](https://sites.google.com/view/l-colmenarejo/home)
  > Laura finished her PhD thesis titled "Stability in the combinatorics of representation theory" in 2016.
  > Laura currently hold a tenure track position at North Carolina State Univesity, and a rising star in the area of Algebraic Combinatorics.

  
  
- [Stefan Trandafir](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Stefan-Trandafir)
  > Stefan was a frecuent visitor to the group during
  >  his PhD at Simon Fraser University in Vacouver. During
  > this time, he delved deeper into some ideas regarding the
  > study of Kronecker coefficients, which partially stemmed
  > from our group's discussions.
  > Additionally, he collaborated us in an article on a new
  > symmetry exhibited by the Littlewood-Richardso
  > coefficients.
  > Stefan currently holds a
  > postdoctoral position with the quantum information group of
  >  Adan Cabello in Sevilla.
- [Álvaro Gutiérrez Cáceres](https://sites.google.com/view/gutierrez-caceres/)

  > Álvaro's undergraduate senior thesis yielded two
  > publications on the study of the plethysm of
  > symmetric functions. Following his time in
  >  Sevilla, Álvaro authored a Master's thesis at the
  > University of Bonn under the supervision of Catharina
  > Stroppel and Jacob Matherne. Presently, he is pursuing
  >  his Ph.D. under the guidance of Mark Wildon at
  > Bristol University.

- Luis Esquivias and Adrian Lillo.
   > In a working group (together with Álvaro and the senior
   > members of the group), Luis and Álvaro, at the time
   >  undergraduate students, found a combinatorial proof of
   > the Graham and Pollak formula for the determinant of the
   > distance matrix of a tree based on the Gessel-Viennot
   > involution.
